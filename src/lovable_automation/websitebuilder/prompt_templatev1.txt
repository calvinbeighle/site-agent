Context:
You are a world-class full-stack web developer using Lovable.dev to comprehensively redesign a website for a business in the {{INDUSTRY}} industry. The current site ({{SITE_URL}}) is outdated and underperforming in design, UX, and technical execution. Your objective is to deliver a high-conversion, visually compelling, and modern website that exemplifies the premium UX/UI standards showcased by industry-leading, award-winning Squarespace websites such as Architecture Plus Information, Yarza Twins, Mike Perry Studio, Caylon Hackwith, and Gretel New York.

Task:

Carefully extract all textual content from: {{SITE_URL}}.

Preserve core messaging, tone, and service descriptions but:

Rewrite for clarity, persuasion, and SEO optimization.

Completely disregard existing structural or stylistic choices.

2. Develop a Modern Website Structure
Create a new website from scratch, featuring core pages typical of high-performing {{INDUSTRY}} sites:

Home Page:

Engaging hero headline and concise elevator pitch.

Visually compelling, strategically placed CTA.

3. Emphasize Premium UI/UX Principles (Inspired by Squarespace Showcase)
Your design must thoughtfully and consistently emphasize these seven core aesthetic and functional principles:

1. Minimalist and Clean Layouts

Generous, intentional use of white space.

Uncluttered, visually pleasing presentation.

Only essential content—minimal distractions.

2. High-Quality Visual Content

Use professional, striking photography or artwork.

High-resolution images optimized for clarity and speed.

Visually appealing textures, backgrounds, and graphic elements.

3. Bold and Intentional Typography

Typography carefully selected to clearly communicate brand personality.

Strategic use of font size, weight, and style to guide visual hierarchy.

Typography serving as a visual design element—not merely informational.

4. Engaging and Interactive Elements

Subtle animations, dynamic scrolling effects.

Thoughtful, interactive hover states and transitions.

Movement integrated naturally, never overwhelming.

5. Consistent Brand Identity

Cohesive visual language across all pages.

Colors, typography, imagery aligned consistently with brand identity.

Intentional, purposeful design choices reflecting brand uniqueness.

6. Thoughtful Content Structure

Clear, intuitive navigation and organization.

Prioritization of key content for effective user journeys.

Concise, impactful messaging that respects user attention.

7. Responsiveness and Accessibility

Fully responsive design optimized for mobile-first experiences.

Fast loading times and smooth interactions.

Adherence to accessibility best practices (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML).

These elements combined must create a website that is visually stunning, highly memorable, and exceptionally functional, reflecting the premium quality exemplified by Squarespace's featured designs.

4. Integrate Industry-Specific Features
Include modern, highly functional, and user-focused components relevant to the industry:

Consulting: booking calendars, tiered service pricing, lead-generation forms.

Real Estate: dynamic property galleries, interactive map filters, intuitive inquiry forms.

Healthcare: secure patient forms, clearly structured insurance information, accessible FAQ sections.

(Select relevant examples depending on {{INDUSTRY}}.)

5. Technical Specifications

Fully optimized for SEO (meta tags, schema markup, clean URLs, internal linking).

Accessible, responsive, and performance-optimized (fast-loading assets, image optimization, semantic markup).

Guidelines:

Utilize high-quality, royalty-free images (Unsplash, etc.) aligned with the premium aesthetic of industry-leading websites.

Employ contemporary Google Fonts that enhance brand personality and readability.

Absolutely ignore the existing website's visual style; this is a ground-up, industry-leading redesign.

Provide clean, modular, scalable code for easy future maintenance and extension.

Avoid generic filler content or lorem ipsum—fully rewritten and optimized copy only.

Specific Font Recommendations:
Carefully select modern, fresh, and approachable Google Fonts that convey trustworthiness, innovation, and clarity without appearing overly formal. Suggested font pairings include:

Primary (Headlines/Hero Text):

Sora – Crisp, modern sans-serif with excellent readability and friendly appeal.

Poppins – Contemporary, clean, and rounded typeface, ideal for youthful yet professional headlines.

Secondary (Body Text/Subheadings):

Plus Jakarta Sans – Clear, stylish sans-serif suitable for digital interfaces and modern brands.

Manrope – Versatile, highly readable typeface conveying confidence and simplicity.

Typography choices should intentionally balance visual impact and readability, creating an inviting and engaging user experience consistent with a forward-thinking investment brand.

Constraints:

Completely disregard visual elements of the existing website (colors, fonts, layout, imagery).

The redesigned website must clearly reflect the current gold-standard UI/UX principles detailed above, inspired by Squarespace showcase exemplars.

Deliverable:
A fully functional, deployable website project:

Clean, modular codebase structured for future scalability.

Comprehensive, optimized SEO implementation.

Fully responsive, accessible, and designed according to best practices.
