- **Visual Design**: While the imagery is high-quality, the typography for ""Student"" and ""Residential"" is stylized and may not be the most readable. The color scheme is simple but lacks vibrancy.
  
- **Layout & Structure**: The layout is clean with a clear division between sections, but it feels somewhat basic and lacks a strong visual hierarchy.

- **Navigation**: The navigation is straightforward, but the ""Schedule a Showing"" button is prominent, which is good for conversion. However, the navigation could be more intuitive with clearer labels.

- **Interactivity**: There are no visible interactive elements or animations that enhance user engagement.

- **Mobile Excellence**: Without a mobile view, it's unclear if the site is fully responsive or optimized for mobile devices.

- **Performance & Technical Quality**: The screenshot does not provide information on loading speed or technical errors.

- **Conversion Optimization**: The ""Schedule a Showing"" button is a clear call-to-action, but additional trust signals or conversion elements are not visible.

To improve, consider enhancing the visual hierarchy, adding interactive elements, and ensuring mobile responsiveness.","Context:
You are a world-class full-stack web developer using Lovable.dev to comprehensively redesign a website for a business in the real estate industry. The current site (http://www.yarealty.com) is outdated and underperforming in design, UX, and technical execution.

Carefully extract all textual content from: http://www.yarealty.com.

Preserve core messaging, tone, and service descriptions but:

Rewrite for clarity, persuasion, and SEO optimization.

Completely disregard existing structural or stylistic choices.

2. Develop a Modern Website Structure
Create a new website from scratch, featuring core pages typical of high-performing real estate sites:

Home Page:

Engaging hero headline and concise elevator pitch.

Clear benefits overview.

Visually compelling, strategically placed CTA.

About Page:

Compelling, authentic brand narrative and mission.

Concise, personable team profiles or leadership bios.

Services/Offerings Page:

Clearly organized breakdown of offerings.

Testimonials or Case Studies:

Industry-aligned social proof in a visually compelling format.

Credible, concise narratives or customer experiences.

Contact Page:

Intuitive form and contact details.

Location map if relevant.

Clear, action-oriented CTA to drive engagement.

3. Emphasize Premium UI/UX Principles (Inspired by Squarespace Showcase)
Your design must thoughtfully and consistently emphasize these seven core aesthetic and functional principles:

1. Minimalist and Clean Layouts

Generous, intentional use of white space.

Uncluttered, visually pleasing presentation.

Only essential content—minimal distractions.

2. High-Quality Visual Content

Use professional, striking photography or artwork.

High-resolution images optimized for clarity and speed.

Visually appealing textures, backgrounds, and graphic elements.

3. Bold and Intentional Typography

Typography carefully selected to clearly communicate brand personality.

Strategic use of font size, weight, and style to guide visual hierarchy.

Typography serving as a visual design element—not merely informational.

4. Engaging and Interactive Elements

Subtle animations, dynamic scrolling effects.

Thoughtful, interactive hover states and transitions.

Movement integrated naturally, never overwhelming.

5. Consistent Brand Identity

Cohesive visual language across all pages.

Colors, typography, imagery aligned consistently with brand identity.

Intentional, purposeful design choices reflecting brand uniqueness.

6. Thoughtful Content Structure

Clear, intuitive navigation and organization.

Guidelines:

Absolutely ignore the existing website's visual style; this is a ground-up, industry-leading redesign.

Provide clean, modular, scalable code for easy future maintenance and extension.

Avoid generic filler content or lorem ipsum—fully rewritten and optimized copy only.

Specific Font Recommendations:
Carefully select modern, fresh, and approachable Google Fonts that convey trustworthiness, innovation, and clarity without appearing overly formal. Suggested font pairings include:

Primary (Headlines/Hero Text):

Sora – Crisp, modern sans-serif with excellent readability and friendly appeal.

Poppins – Contemporary, clean, and rounded typeface, ideal for youthful yet professional headlines.

Secondary (Body Text/Subheadings):

Plus Jakarta Sans – Clear, stylish sans-serif suitable for digital interfaces and modern brands.

- **Visual Design**: The color scheme is basic and lacks modern appeal. The use of green and black is not particularly engaging or professional.
- **Typography**: The font choice is plain and does not contribute to a modern or professional look. The text is not well-aligned, and there is inconsistent use of bold and regular fonts.
- **Layout & Structure**: The layout is very basic and lacks a modern grid system. There is a lot of unused space, making the page feel empty and unbalanced.
- **Navigation**: While the navigation bar is present, it lacks visual appeal and modern design elements. It could be more intuitive and engaging.
- **Interactivity**: The page appears static with no interactive elements or modern features like animations or transitions.
- **Mobile Excellence**: Without a mobile view, it's unclear if the site is responsive, but the design suggests potential issues with mobile usability.
- **Conversion Optimization**: There are no clear calls-to-action on the page, which could hinder user engagement and conversion.
- **Content Presentation**: The content is text-heavy and not well-organized, making it difficult to read and engage with. The use of bullet points is inconsistent.

Secondary (Body Text/Subheadings):

Typography choices should intentionally balance visual impact and readability, creating an inviting and engaging user experience consistent with a forward-thinking investment brand.

Constraints:

Completely disregard visual elements of the existing website (colors, fonts, layout, imagery).
